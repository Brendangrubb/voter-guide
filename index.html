          <h2>Voting for Adults</h2>
          <p>Voting is easy, you've been doing it your whole life. Here are the basic steps: Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Ensign Babyface! Your shields were failing, sir. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Damage report!</p>
          <p>Here are some good reasons to vote: When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Besides, you look good in a dress. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. The unexpected is our normal routine. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.</p>

          <h2>Voting for Young People</h2>
          <p>Congratulations on deciding to vote! It is VERY important. Here's why: Computer, lights up! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Your shields were failing, sir. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Sorry, Data. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone.</p>
          <p>You may be wondering, what's the point? Well, I completely understand. Here are some good reasons to participate: We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? and attack the Romulans. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Ensign Babyface! I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. This is not about revenge. This is about justice.</p>
